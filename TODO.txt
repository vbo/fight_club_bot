TODO:
- Add nice buttons
- Make texts really nice
- Add leaderboard
- During the fight forward the messages to allow chat
- If no opponent available - take a bot in N seconds automatically
- Give bots funny names
- Show names of people you are fighting with
- Send "typing" event when waiting for opponents etc.
- Timeout for fights when opponent is not active
- When you hit by 0hp - it is a miss, should be written this way

IDEAS:
- Injuries when hit by more hp than you have
- Crafting
- Fight many to many, many to one
- Sometimes you can miss, espcially if you're aiming head or legs
