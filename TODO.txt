TODO:
- Display more stats about your opponent
- Hit in one of three places, block one of three places
- Add nice buttons
- Make texts really nice
- Add leaderboard
- During the fight forward the messages to allow chat
- If no opponent available - take a bot in N seconds automatically
- Give bots funny names
- Show names of people you are fighting with
- Send "typing" event when waiting for opponents etc.

IDEAS:
- Injuries when hit by more hp than you have
- Crafting
- Fight many to many, many to one

Questions:
- Should database be stored in git repository? Otherwise we will send messages to everybody once again once you run the script
