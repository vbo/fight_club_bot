TODO:
- Make texts really nice
- Add leaderboard
- During the fight forward the messages to allow chat
- Send "typing" event when waiting for opponents etc.
- Different mobs with different complexity of fighting

IDEAS:
- Injuries when hit by more hp than you have
- Crafting
- Fight many to many, many to one
- Sometimes you can miss, espcially if you're aiming head or legs
- It would be very nice to show messages more slowly, as if somebody's typing them
