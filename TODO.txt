TODO:
- Sending messages in other languages (RU)
- Transactions
- Better logs (no empty getUpdates)

IDEAS:
- Add leaderboard / stats
- Crafting
- Different mobs with different complexity of fighting
- Fight many to many, many to one
- Generate fantasy names
- Injuries when hit by more hp than you have
- It would be very nice to show messages more slowly, as if somebody's typing them
- Send "typing" event when waiting for opponents etc.
- Sometimes you can miss, espcially if you're aiming head or legs
